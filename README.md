This is a follow along study i made by using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJdT05zl6jk&list=PLwnSaD6BDfXL0RiKT_5nOIdxTxZWpPtAv&index=2 this source, 
I took the source code from video description as sugested by instructor than modified and coded along you can see the commanented codes from previous lessons 
and they are indicated in comment line which code is realted with which video, I moved set diffuculty from main to a function thought it would be more valid approach.
